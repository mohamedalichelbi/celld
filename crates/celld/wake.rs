#![warn(clippy::disallowed_macros)]

//! Alarm wake for inactive cells (on by default).
//!
//! Committed alarm state is mirrored into the bucket as
//! `wake/<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM>/<cell>` so a wake hint survives fence, crash,
//! and deploy; the sweep evicts alarm-bearing cells behind a durable
//! entry, a per-node heap plus boot scan re-activates them, and a per-fleet
//! advisory waker revives orphans whose owner died.
//!
//! Invariants, verified by deterministic simulation:
//! - arm durable ⟹ entry exists, within one sweep tick of the commit;
//! - only completed activation or a durable consume deletes an entry — a
//!   stale entry costs one spurious wake, a missing entry costs a lost wake;
//! - the flusher never touches the request path: it reads the lock-free
//!   `next_alarm_ms` mirror on the existing 5 s sweep tick.
